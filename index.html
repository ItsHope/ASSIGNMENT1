        <h1 class= "Heading">Carb Cycling</h1>

        <p class="website-information">
            Carb cycling is an interesting concept and has taken the world by storm. In simple terms it can be described as alternating between high carb days and low carb days. It is most popular amongst bodybuilders. With carb cycling you can burn fat without losing a lot or weight or rather without a substantial amount of muscle breakdown.
        <br>
        With that being said women are put in a position where they can control where they “gain weight”. There’s a lot of ways carb cycling can be beneficial but it is especially beneficial alongside specific workouts to women who want to attain a tiny waist while keeping their lower part of the body slightly bigger to give an hour glass figure. Carb Cycling can be confusing and very overwhelming if you don’t have a plan. BassyFit is here to hold your hand through the first week of your carb cycling diet with a one week carb cycling challenge. The challenge consists of 2 high carb day meals, 2 moderate carb day meals, 3 low carb days as well as workout suggestions.
