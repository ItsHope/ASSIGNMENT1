        <h1>What is Interaction for Data Visualisation? 
 
        </h1>

        <p>
            In this paper Dimara.E and Perin. C conduct a research in order to define interaction and the view different field have about it and what it means to them, specifically interaction in visualisation as well as in HCI. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Firstly HCI is Human-Computer interaction and can be described as “the casual relationship between the human and the computer”, (Dimara.E and Perin, 2020). 
        </p>


        <p>
            Overall over the years there has been development of interest in enriching interactivity in data visual representation. Interactivity in data visualisation mean that the consumer of the interactive data visualisation at the time has free well to construct understanding of the data, they can sketch for example. They have freedom to author and even personalise that data. Although this can be seen as a different way to explore how data visualisation can be taken in. 
           
        </p> 

        <p>
            But like any new phenomenon there have also been the negatives. Interaction in data visualisation has sparked questions as well as arguments about the nature and the role of interaction.  


        </p>



        <p>
            The paper is about the research process, the methodology, challenges and etc. In conclusion the two authors seek to define Interactivity through understanding the view of interaction from the visualisation community as well as the HCI community. The views were assessed and looked at whether there is some relation at all. Through this the definition of interaction in data visualisation will be constructed. 
        </p>


        <p>
            The research was conducted with a methodology rationale that was said to be completely fair with a set of requirements that emphasize this. One requirement was not including HCI papers that were unrelated to visualization. 
        </p>

        <p>
            To get a general consensus of the definition of interaction, papers were gathered that included the definition of interaction. Methods like coming up with tags were used too and linking papers using an interactive detective coding method. 
        </p>


        <p>
            To get into how the research was conducted more. Numerous visualisation experts were recruited to ensure that there isn’t any kind of bias from the two researchers. Participants taking surveys was another method used. Experts with years of data visualisation experience as well as everyday anonymous people took the same surveys. In total it came to 59 tagged papers and the view of interaction was based only on those 59 papers.
        </p>


        <p>
            These contained the definition of interaction for visualization. Most of them had common keywords like user as well as the data, the word dialogue was also evident in most of them.
        </p>
        

        <p>
            Another common notion was that interaction can involve external physical objects such as a mouse a keyboard and physical constraints. These are just some of the findings while conducting the research. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion for the for the visualization view, it was found that interaction is conceptualized as a dialogue between a human user and a visualization system over a central objects of interest (Dimara.E and Perin, 2020).  While for the HCI view of interaction, there keywords that help make construct the understanding of interaction. These keywords include dialogue, transmission, control, tool use as well as optimal behaviour. Ultimately the transmission concept assumes that the user has a message in mind, the tool a task to be accomplished and the optical behaviour defines interaction as utility. By comparing the visualization and the HCI views of interaction we can articulate differences and compare and have a proposal on a definition of interaction to encourage novel and more flexible interaction design practices.
