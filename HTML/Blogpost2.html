        <h1>Close critical analysis on the Design, UI and UX of the home page of Pinterest.</h1>

        <p>
            Pinterest in an online image sharing visual discovery that is used for finding new ideas for fashion, home, just styling in general (Pintrest, 2021). This essay will closely analyse Pinterest’ home page, its design and if the website has good UI and UX.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Pinterest’s homepage consists of two main design colours. These are the colour white/light grey as well as the colour red. There are dashes of black and a darker shade of black too. The website has a common design template. A navigation bar at the top of the page and content right beneath. Content that is what the whole website is about, images. Immediately after the navigation bar, users are met with pictures of their interests and as they scroll down there is even more pictures. On the bottom right of the page there are two icons to interact with. One is a plus sign for sharing photos and below that a question mark that opens up a pop up tiny window with an “About, Help Center, Developers and Terms” essentially the header of the home page. 
        </p>


        <p>
            
            The webpage has responsive design. On desktop, pinterest has bigger icons on the navigation bar as well as a longer search bar that shrinks to fit appropriately when the site is opened on a mobile cell phone.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Referencing lecture slides “usability is closely related to user experience”. Pinterest is an easy to use site especially when you are familiar with social media sites. This is because the navigation bar/header consists mostly of icons that are common amongst social media sites.  These icons include the bell icon for notifications, a speech bubble for messaging to name a few, there is also a search as mentioned before. Finally there is also a home bar to refresh the page. These icons are in appropriate size for the screen they are presented in, whether mobile or on a computer screen. They are legible too even after they’ve been shrunk to fit a mobile screen. This is good UI, aesthetically pleasing icons on all screens.

        <p>
            Goto refers to user experience as “the overall perception and comprehensive interaction that an individual has with a company, service or product” (Goto, 2004). The placement or design template in general is conventional and gives users familiarity and personally contributed to my first experience with the site. I knew where I needed to go to do a specific action. There was comprehensive interaction. 
        </p>


        <p>
            On usability, there are mouse cursor switches that come with interacting or hovering over different things on the page. When hovering over the search bar, the mouse cursor is the text select cursor that hints that users can input text in the search bar. When hovering on icons, the cursor is the finger one and finally when hovering over pictures the cursor is the zoom in/magnifying one. These switches contribute to the usability of the site, accessibility which is another aspect of user experience as well as the UI. Accessibility in the site includes the sticky nav bar. It is always in reach and accessible no matter how much you scroll down.
