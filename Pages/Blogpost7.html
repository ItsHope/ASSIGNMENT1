        <h1>Analysis of Information is Beautiful – Interactivity as semiotic device
            </h1>

        <p>
            Data Visualisation available https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Online interactivity is enabled when a user clicks on usually visualisation on the screen. This includes a graph, the graph’s legend and sometimes even text. On that click, data visualisation will be represented differently or there will be an animation, just a general visible change in appearance. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>

            The new appearance will then communicate a different or a new message, new data is presented.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “According to Chandler, a text can be any ‘assemblage of signs (such as words, images, sounds and/or gestures) constructed (and interpreted) with reference to the conventions associated with … a particular medium of communication’ (2014)”
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Through this, interactivity is used as a semiotic device because the physical performances done by the user on the screen execute changes. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            The Corona Virus Infection Trajectories data visualisation only become clear of its representation on click. After loading the page, even with the title of what the graph represents (The Corona Virus Infection Trajectories), it is unclear to identify, what represents what, it is difficult to understand the graph. My first guess was that since the graph is a line graph, the lines represent the total cases of the corona virus in all the countries represented on the right. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            But the graph offers even more with just a click on it. Once a user clicks on any line in the graph. A country name in a box pop up shows up, the box pop up not only includes the total cases of the corona virus, other data like total deaths in that country are included, new cases and etc. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This information for each country is not provided before the interactivity. Another form of change that happens after interactivity is fading out the other countries and have one country/ one colour at a time after clicking on a specific colour on the legend. The country Poland is represented with a dark orange on the graph and on the legend. To have it only it visible while the rest of the countries are faded out, a user would have to click on that same colour on the legend. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Interactivity in that way has the power to give a user the full experience of a piece of data visualisation. Semiotically it constructs new information, therefore we can say that online interactivity can be used as a semiotic device.
