        <h1>Critical Reflection on the Week Carb Cycling Data Visualisation</h1>



        <img style="float: left;" alt="" src="../Images/Data-driven art.png" width="800" height="500" />




        <p>
            A perfect carb cycling week consists of two high carb days, 
            two moderate carb days as well as 3 low carb days. 

        </p>

        <p>
          <b> High Carb Foods include </b>
           <li>Bananas</li>
           <li>Flour</li>

            <b> Low Carb Foods include </b>
           <li>Fish</li>
           <li>Eggs</li>
           <li>Avocados</li>

           <li>Apples</li>

        </p>
        <br>

    <p>
        To represent this visually I drew a bar graph-like visualisation that uses the bars to construct meaning as well as the food. The bar representing high carb days is the longs and emphasizes "high" carb days. In the bar there are food examples. High carb days is followed by the moderate carb days bar. The bar is shorter to emphasize "moderate". The two bars (High carbs and moderate carbs) are the same in width to represent the 2 days for both. This is completely the opposite for the bar representing  low carb days. In constrast, it is shorter or the shortest to represent low carbs. The bar is also the widest to represent the extra one day longer than the other bars. Low carb days are 3 days. To symbolise the difference in the amount of days, the numbers are also highlighted differently. The number 2 for both high and moderate carb days are the colour orange while number 3 is in colour red.
