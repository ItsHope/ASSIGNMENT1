            Kidd states that representation is concerned with the construction of meaning. Analysing the graph above, at
            first glance it seems like good data visualisaion because the countries are written in bold (images are
            raley consumed in isolation, (knaflic, chapter 6)) and with the lines connecting the name and a part of the
            graph.


        </p>


        <p>
            To start with the lines. They were displayed well because thet are faint and thin compared to the rest of
            the graph as well as they text. The only serve for connection and do not need to be highlighted because they
            are not a huge part of the graph.
        </p>





        <p>
            The different sections of the graph are in different colours so that suggests differences in countries or
            values without necessarily relying only on text.
